# p5-Graphics-Assignment-1-CSC-2463-
First graphics assignment for "Programming Digital Media"

Write a P5 sketch to reproduce each of the following images as closely as possible. See the P5 reference page for an overview of P5's basic shape drawing capabilities, and keep these in mind as you determine how to best produce each image.

Be sure to format your code consistently and correctly.

ZIP your sketches directory with all HTML files and JS files, and attach that ZIP to your Moodle submission.
